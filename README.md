# hello-world
==============

Hi Humans,

My name is Omar Mousa. I am an undergraduate student at The George Washington University majoring in Integrated Information, Science and Technology. I am interested in the application of technology to imporve the human condition, thus driving my interest in health informatics. I am currently interning at Booz Allen Hamilton as a cyber intern. My reason for writing this README is to satsify the requirements for the HELLO WORLD tutorial.
